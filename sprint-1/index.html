          Xavier De Ronsay and Gaspard Augé had a few mutual friends, who
          happened to run a record label, seeking tracks for a compilation. With
          an immediate connection, the pair decided to try their hand at making
          a song. That’s when they created their breakout single, We Are Your
          Friends – a feel-good, funk-filled, instant anthem that lost the remix
          contest, but won the attention of Pedro Winter, director of the newly
          founded Ed Banger Records, who boasted Daft Punk as former clients.
          One week later, they were in his office, signing a record deal.
